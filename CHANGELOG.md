# Changelog

`registry_version` in `checklist.json` tracks the audit contract — which items
exist and what each one asserts. It changes whenever the checklist changes, which
is not the same event as the plugin changing. This file tracks the plugin: the
runner, the report, the scripts and the run modes around that contract.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` before 1.0, where the minor is bumped for
anything that changes what a run produces — including a change that makes the
output *more* honest. A verdict that used to be `PASS` and is now `NO_DATA` is a
breaking change for whoever read the old number, and saying so is the point.

## 0.2.0 — 3 August 2026

Registry `7b8c8a3295fd` (211 items) → `5bf1e36d657f` (214 items).
Tests 90 → 229, all offline. First release with CI that has actually executed.

### The theme

Every change below came from running the tool rather than reading it. Nine of
them were verdicts that were fabricated: a number in the report that nobody
looking at the report could tell was invented. The audit's one promise is that
"we could not check this" never reads as pass or fail, and each of these broke it
somewhere specific.

### Changed — a run can now produce different verdicts than 0.1.0 did

- **A page that is not the site is no longer scored.** Bot-protection
  interstitials (Cloudflare, Incapsula, PerimeterX, DataDome, AWS WAF, Sucuri,
  Distil) and soft 404s are detected before grading, and the items that need the
  real page report `NO_DATA` with the reason instead of grading the challenge
  page. 0.1.0 scored a Cloudflare challenge 6 PASS / 10 FAIL. `--no-page-guard`
  restores the old behaviour when the interstitial *is* the thing being audited.
  Detection is by fingerprint, so an unknown vendor still gets through — the
  thin-entry warning surfaces the symptom without deciding, because an unknown
  interstitial and a client-rendered shell are indistinguishable from the HTML
  and the second is a real finding.
- **Cross-host redirects are followed for real.** The final URL is carried into
  the audit instead of being discarded, so a site that redirects to another host
  is audited as that host rather than reported against a URL nobody fetched.
- **Outbound requests are paced.** 4 requests/second/host by default
  (`--max-rps`), enforced across processes with a locked slot file, and
  `Retry-After` is honoured on 429/503. `--workers 8` with `--sample N`
  previously burst against a third party with no pacing at all. Audits are
  slower; this is the only change here that protects somebody other than the
  audit's own honesty.
- **Fifteen assertions that could never fire have been replaced.** Six of 21
  regex-over-prose rules did what they claimed; the other fifteen matched nothing
  in any output and so returned `PASS` unconditionally. Structured assertions
  where the script emits usable data, `llm` or `manual` where it does not.
  `tools/audit_assertions.py` now fails the build if a pattern cannot fire, and
  it also catches a rule matching its own module docstring, its own argparse help
  or its own remediation text — three real cases (CI-013, KW-072, KW-073).
- **Eight items moved from `script` to `llm`** because the scripts they named had
  never looked at what they asked about. Five of those are measurable rather than
  judgeable and became browser-measured instead: `rendered_audit.py` reads type
  size, link distinguishability, overlays and tap-target size from a real render.
  Mobile-only metrics are dropped rather than zeroed when the trace was a desktop
  window. Without the artifact these report `NO_DATA`, so coverage on a plain run
  is lower than 0.1.0 reported — 0.1.0's number was higher and wrong.
- **Search Console items that no API can answer are `MANUAL`**, not `NO_DATA`
  pending a key that would never satisfy them.
- **Timeout is distinguished from crash** from a missing script and from unusable
  output. All four were one silent `NO_DATA` before.
- **The registrable domain comes from the Public Suffix List** (bundled dated
  snapshot, MPL 2.0, `tools/refresh_public_suffix_list.py --check`), so the
  default `sc-domain:` property is right for `example.co.uk` and friends.
- **The report is written for the person paying for it.** Four layers in one
  file: a three-sentence plain summary before any number, category bars with a
  plain-language explanation of what each group of checks protects, fix cards
  carrying the measurement as a sentence, and the full checklist with raw
  evidence folded underneath. The Markdown and HTML structure both changed; a
  consumer parsing 0.1.0's tables will not find them.

### Added

- Three lab Core Web Vitals items (SP-214/215/216) via `cwv_metrics.py`: the
  agent traces with a real browser, the script reads the artifact, the registry
  decides from thresholds. TBT stands in for INP, which cannot be measured from a
  page load, and says so.
- An adversarial second reading of the LLM verdicts (`--llm-review`) that can
  only withdraw confidence: agreement corroborates, disagreement returns the item
  to `NO_DATA` carrying both readings, and the reviewer cannot answer an
  unanswered item or overwrite a verdict.
- `--lang` and a Russian translation of the report chrome and all 16 category
  explanations. Item titles and recommendations are not translated yet, so
  `--lang ru` produces a half-Russian document and now says so on stderr.
  **Client delivery is English-only until those are filled in.**
- CI on Python 3.11 and 3.13: registry gate, assertion gate, `compileall`, the
  Public Suffix snapshot's date, and four end-to-end runs including an
  unreachable site and a challenge page.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), upstream licence text reproduced in `CREDITS.md`, and source
  provenance recorded inside `plerdy-titles.json` itself rather than only
  alongside it.

### Fixed

- The rate limiter crashed 36 of 56 scripts in its first live run. The slot file
  was opened `"a+"`, POSIX append ignores `seek`/`truncate`, timestamps
  concatenated, and the resulting `ValueError` escaped a handler that only caught
  `OSError`. Score read 72/100 at 29% coverage instead of 79/100 at 64%.
- The report printed `SEO Score None/100` when the entry page could not be read.
- History picked the wrong previous run: ISO timestamps were compared against
  filename stamps as strings, so a legacy file always won.
- Two runs in the same second overwrote each other's history entry.
- `broken_image_count: None` graded `eq: 0` as `FAIL`. The key is now absent when
  images were not checked, so the item reports `NO_DATA`.
- `local_seo_checker.py` reported a high-severity `FAIL` on a site with valid
  `Restaurant` schema, because `LocalBusiness` was matched as a string against
  `@type` rather than against its subtypes.
- The fix list ranked by severity alone: `effort` never reached the report, so
  the Effort column printed `?`.
- Page-sampled items showed a passing measurement under a failing verdict — the
  verdict came from the worst page, the number from the entry page.
- `article_seo.py` crashed on JSON-LD in array or `@graph` form; `lib/safe_http.py`
  exited the process at import when `requests` was absent;
  `validate_skill_inventory.py` had a regex that never matched, so the check it
  performed validated nothing.
- Three script counts in `plugin.json`, `CREDITS.md` and the research record
  disagreed with each other and with the tree.

## 0.1.0 — 3 August 2026

First version. 211 items, 90 offline tests, no repository and no CI yet.

Established what the rest of this file defends: a fixed registry generated from
the checklist and content-hashed, declarative assertions rather than per-item
code, SEO Score and Coverage reported separately and never merged, and a status
vocabulary where `NO_DATA` and `MANUAL` stay in the coverage denominator so an
unanswered question cannot be quietly rounded into a good result.
